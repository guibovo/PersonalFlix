PersonalFlix
============
This is a simple "personal" Netflix, to stream personal videos in a local server.

I've done this personal project to make my own video selection and player in my home server.


CHANGE THE VIDEOS PATH
=======================
You should obbey the path "/Videos/", and than, inside "/Videos/"
you should organize each MOVIE in separated FOLDERS with 2 FILES insed it,
one that is ".jpg" to be the MOVIE FOLDER, and the other should be 
a MOVIE extension (HTML 5 ONLY accepts ".mp4", ".ogg", ".webm")
